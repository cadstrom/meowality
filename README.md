# Meowality - CrossLink NX mixed reality

(early WIP - outline ideas)

Per eye:
 - H381DLN01.0 or equivalent 1080x1200x90fps AMOLED
 - iMX477 camera using the 4-lane 22-pin Pi connector (should be 1080p120+ capable)
 - LIFCL-40-9BG400C FPGA
 - ICM-20948 IMU
 - possibly epc611 8x8 TOF array
 - connector for RGB cat ear addon

M.2 slot for WiFi module using CrossLink NX for hypothetical wireless VR with minimal stack (raw packets and minimal DPCM type compression only).
